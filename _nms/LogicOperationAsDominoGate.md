title: Logic Operation as Domino Gate
author: matthias
ProgrammingLanguage: any
ProgrammingParadigm: any
ConceptualAdvantage: "See inside logic gates/operations. Construct/invent them from atomic components, and observe/analyze their full workings."
Form: Analogy
DrawsAttentionTo: "The inner workings of a Boolean logic operation (and, or, xor)."
UseWhen: "To learn about Boolean logic operations (and, or, xor, ...)."
Cost: "Need domino pieces. Introduces an alternative real machine (e.g., implementation of domino AND is not exactly the same as implementation of electronic circuit AND). Mechanical inaccuracies can cause problems."
OriginSource: "Own practice, based on Matt Parker's 'domino computer'"

Mapping:
  "Boolean value": "domino piece (standing, or fallen)"
  "or operation": "two joining lines of dominos"
  "xor operation": "two lines of dominos like in left image"
  "and operation": "two lines of dominos like in right image"
  "function argument": "first domino piece in a line"
  "function return value": "last domino piece in a line"

The idea is described as "Domino Circuit",
one of three different programming languages that strive to eliminate abstraction,
in Hauswirth, Adamoli, and Azadmanesh's
[The Program is the System](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3141880.3141894).

This notional machine was used to logic operations to high school students and the general public in the 10-year anniversary exhibition
of the Faculty of Informatics of USI.
